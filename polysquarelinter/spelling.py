"""Implements spell-checking functionality for polysquarelinter.

The main two functions of interest are
spellcheckable_and_shadow_contents and spellcheck_region.

spellcheckable_and_shadow_contents will return a tuple
of both a list of _ChunkInfo classes and a shadow region.

The _ChunkInfo classes, represent a region spanning some lines
of text. The data member of _ChunkInfo is a list of lines covering
that region.

The shadow region is an array of characters with 1-1 mapping on the rest
of the input lines which were not covered by any chunk. This can
be used, for example, to generate a list of "technical words" used
in the rest of the file. technical_words_from_shadow_contents provides
this functionality as a convenience.

spellcheck_region takes a list of lines and spell-checks every
word in that region. If it detects an error it will return
a SpellcheckError indicating the offset into that chunk
the error was detected.
